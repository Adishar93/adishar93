### Hi! I am Aditya Sharma [he/him],

I’m a Master’s student at USC with a 4.0 GPA, graduating in May 2025. With over three years of experience in Software Engineering, I’ve optimized backend services at Exotel, saving $60,000 annually, and developed scalable APIs at Principal Financial Group.

In addition to my backend work, I’ve developed full-stack projects, such as a Stock Management Platform with a well-designed UI in Angular and dynamic features. I’m also proud of my AI-related achievements, including my Othello bot ranking 1st out of 216 in a competitive AI game, and winning two hackathons, one focused on LLMs

I’m a strong team player with excellent communication skills and a proven ability to thrive in fast-paced environments. Having worked at startups, I’m experienced in keeping stakeholders updated on project progress and setting clear expectations. I’m always eager to learn, adapt to new technologies, and contribute to the success of my team.
